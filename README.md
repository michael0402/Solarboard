# Solaboard Remote Controller

This repository contains the needed software for the remote and the receiver, to control an electric longbaord. To properly use the software one must install certain Arduino Libraries in order to compile the arduino sketches. The Arduino IDE comes with most of the needed libraries, but you will ned to manually install VescUartControl from RollingGecko: https://github.com/RollingGecko/VescUartControl.
